Robotics in healthcare is a difficult and controversial subject due to many factors, some of the more prominent being that people like having a human presence when their internal organs are being worked.  However, robotics can greatly improve the effectiveness while reducing the cost of healthcare in many ways.
\newline
One way robotics can improve the effectiveness of healthcare is during invasive surgical procedures that would normally require a doctor to be flown in and a bigger incision to be made so the surgeon can see and access the region he is operating.  One of improvements in surgery is the introduction of laparoscopic procedures in which surgeons create a small incision and perform the operation through that incision.  This method of surgery has the benefit of improving recovering time and reducing infection rates because the incisions are much smaller than traditional surgery.  This type of surgery is difficult to perform because of the size of the incision and the surgeon’s ability to see into incision.  Robots are particularly well suited to this type of surgery because cameras can be put on to the end of small manipulators that can be inserted into the small incisions making it easy for the surgeon to see in.  Robots can also be operated remotely, so surgeons don’t need to be flown in from around the world they can remotely control the robot.  This improves both recovery times for the patients and reduces the cost of surgery because smaller incisions are needed and surgeons don’t need to travel to perform the operation.  An example of a robot that fills this need and is currently in use is the Da Vinci robot.
\newline
A second way that robots can improve healthcare is in general checkups in the hospital.  This would typically require a doctor to make regular time consuming rounds of a hospital to perform simple checkups
